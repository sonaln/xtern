Part 1:
Most of the data is categorical variables. The goal is to predict the meal ordered.

Part 2:
1. It is unethical to collect students personal data such as their year, major, or college without their permission. 
2. Analyzing this data could be useful to understand trends in meals that students order based on their characteristics.
3. Some technical implications include inaccurate predicitive modeling and data that doesn't quite meet the test data.

Part 3:
I would determine if I collected this data ethically, and whether analyzing and creating a predictive model of this
data would serve useful to future needs. Furthermore, I would ensure to keep updating this data over time to ensure
that the training data is up to date and the predicitive model is more accurate to accustom to change trends and patterns
in student eating habits.
